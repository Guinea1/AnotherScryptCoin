AnotherScryptCoin
=====================================

What is AnotherScryptCoin?
----------------

AnotherScryptCoin is exactly what it says it is, It's based off of Litecoin (source 0.18) and is slightly "faster". This is mostly just a fun project. Many things likely still say "Litecoin" in docs and other areas.
