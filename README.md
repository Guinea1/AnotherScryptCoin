AnotherScryptCoin
=====================================

What is AnotherScryptCoin?
----------------

AnotherScryptCoin is exactly what it says it is, It's based off of Litecoin (source 0.18) and is slightly "faster". This is mostly just a fun project. Many things likely still say "Litecoin" in docs and other areas, I didn't fork Litecoin and removed the original .git folder because that caused issues when trying to push.

You may need to include -addnode=127.0.0.1 in your command when starting, so that the dns seeder picks up your IP.
